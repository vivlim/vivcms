# adventure!
walk around like a text-only adventure game with simple verbs like the cardinal directions, enter, etc. all expressed as links on the page

goal is to meander around and find links to things i made and think are cool

also an option to skip it and just see a list of stuff if you're in a hurry.

mad lib kinda thing? simple questions with freeform answers?
polls? like, you find a fish in a bowl. do you set it free in the river? do it keep it with you? do you *drink the fish*??

guestbook? maybe you can pick up cosmetic items which don't do anything or ask you to describe
like you get a hat and i ask for an adjective
if you sign a guestbook or something, the hat you had is recorded as part of that

you look at a drawing of a dog on the wall. upon closer inspection you see a wormhole behind the drawing which would take you to rachelshneyer.com

'bizarre spatial homepage'

## data model
rooms are connected to other rooms by verbs
rooms are also connected to `content` by verbs
there's also a master index of `content` so anything the game links to can be found normally


# ok but what are the things you do want to link to
* work (intellicode?)
* starhill
* twitter accounts
